# Semantic Segmentation of Ultrasound Images to Isolate and Discover Brachial Plexus Nerves

This project implements semantic segmentation of ultrasound images to isolate and identify brachial plexus nerves using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The project utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. A rudimentary GUI is made for demonstration purposes via TKinter

- ## Introduction

Ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool in medical diagnostics, particularly for visualizing nerves such as the brachial plexus. This project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and isolating brachial plexus nerves from ultrasound images using a U-Net CNN.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of annotated ultrasound images. Each image is paired with a corresponding mask that highlights the brachial plexus nerves.
